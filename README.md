The King Of Thieves Dungeon Designer, King of Thieves DD, or Kot DD is a Java made application that allows the user to create any type of dungeon, with any number of traps and other stuff. The main use for this app is, in the case that someone asks you what layout for a certain dungeon it's the best, you open Kot DD and you create the best layout you think there is. 

For example, for the current version of the program, editing a layout for the ``base 73`` would look like this:<br>

Note: All dungeons in the app follows the order made in the <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/857474425279741982/908792147568898048/bases.jpg"> Alucen's scheme.</a>

## IMPORTANT - CONTRIBUTIONS
There are some important bugs in the application that i don't know how to fix them because I'm not an expert inside Java desktop applications
development and I can't find any help about that bugs. Those are:

- `#1` Opening menu bug: When opening any of the menubar items, all the images/labels that where located into the frame go to the start position
where they spawned at the beggining. 

- `#2` Rotating a label bug : Same as opening a menu item but when trying to rotate a label / change it's icon to the same but rotated.
