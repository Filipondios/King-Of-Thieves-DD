The King Of Thieves Dungeon Dessigner, King of Thieves DD, or Kot DD is a Java made application that allows the user to create any type of dungeon, with any number of traps and other stuff. The main use for this app is, in the case that someone asks you what layout for a certain dungeon its the best, you open Kot DD and you create the best layout you think there is. 

For example, for the current version of the program, an empty layout for the ``base 108`` would look like this:<br>

Note: All dungeons in the app follows the order made in the <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/857474425279741982/908792147568898048/bases.jpg"> AlucenÂ´s scheme.</a>

# How to run the program
## Instalation via link
Dowload the ``.zip`` current version of the program with the necessary files <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Filipondios/King-Of-Thieves-DD/main/current-version/KOTDD.zip">in this link</a>.
Then, you have two options:
- Double click in the .jar file
- Or in the command line, in the same folder that the .jar file is located, run the next command:
```bash
java -jar KOTDD.jar
```
## Installatiion via command line
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Filipondios/King-Of-Thieves-DD.git
cd King-Of-Thieves-DD/current-version/
unzip KOTDD.zip && java -jar KOTDD.jar
```
<b> The easier option is the first, but if you are using a window manager in linux, maybe the faster one is the second. </b>
