This .zip file that is located in this folder contains the necessary files to run Kot Dungeon Dessigner.
This one includes the next files, in the next order:

--> KOTDD.jar ( file )
--> resources ( folder )
	--> images ( folder )
		--> bases ( folder )
			--> base04.gif ( file )
			--> base05.gif ( file )
			--> base06.gif ( file )
			--> base07.gif ( file )
			.
			.
			.
			--> base125.gif ( file )
			--> grid.gif ( file )
		--> basic ( folder )
			--> icon.png ( file )
		--> init ( folder )
			--> logo.png ( file )
		--> items ( folder )
			--> door.png ( file )
			--> gravity.png ( file )
		--> traps ( folder )
			
The "resources" folder is COMPLETELY NECESSARY to run the program. If you delete or move this folder
to other place, KotDD won't work or the application will work badly (bad graphics, etc).
